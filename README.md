# Caffeine-Consumption-Level-Analysis

This repository contains a Power BI dashboard showing caffeine consumption levels from different sellers and different coffee products to help consumers regulate intake and buy coffe products wisely.

The dashboard was inspired by the [workout-wednesday 2023 week 15 power BI](https://workout-wednesday.com/pbi-2023-w15/) challenge with data from [Data.world](https://data.world/makeovermonday/2023w9/workspace/file?filename=Coffee+Caffeine+Content.xlsx)

Actual caffeine content in beverages varies widely.
For healthy adults, the [US Food and Drug Administration has cited 400 milligrams a day as a (safe) caffeine amount not generally associated with dangerous, negative effects.](https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/spilling-beans-how-much-caffeine-too-much)

Using data from various coffee sellers namely Costa, Gregs, Pret, Caffe Nero and Starbucks, I analyzed the amount of caffeine in different coffee products that they sell.

On Power BI, I performed what-if analysis to slice data by the number of coffee cups.

The Dashboard shows that to achieve a maximum intake of 400mg of caffeine, different coffee products from coffee shops cap at a different number of coffee cups. This can be observed by dragging the slider on the number of coffee cups taken slicer. The columns for coffee sellers turn red when caffeine level is high(<= 400mg) and remain blue for the sellers at a safe caffeinne level of below 400mg.

This table below summarizes the overall results showing caffeine content per cup and the maximum number of coffee cups one can consume from different sellers to achieve a safe maximum daily caffeine intake of 400mg for different coffee products.

The Power BI [dashboard](https://github.com/Angie-O/Caffeine-Consumption-Level-Analysis/blob/main/CaffeineConsumption%20Dashboard%20and%20Summary%20Table.pdf) and [template file](https://github.com/Angie-O/Caffeine-Consumption-Level-Analysis/blob/main/Caffeine%20Consumption.pbix) are available for exploration and review of the analysis, and I welcome any feedback or queries on the findings.
